Lucy is a sex columnist, or rather, she writes smutty online listicles. 

She has no friends, only friends-with-benefits: Mr. Good Time the psychonaut, Ms. Blue the ra-ra activist, Mr. Shit-hit-the-fan the oligarch's wife's PA, and Mr. Pre-incarceration the boiler repairman. 

After a string of bad choices and a lost bet involving a threesome, she finds herself on a cheap flight to Iran. Problem is, the basic bitch doesnâ€™t know where Iran is on a map. She didn't even pack a headscarf. Overwhelmed and far from home, there are only two things to comfort her: Iranians are incredibly good looking, and she enjoys being the forbidden fruit. 

This romance novel is based on real events over the summer of 2018, with names and other small details changed to protect the guilty.
