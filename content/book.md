Lucy is a sex columnist (or rather, she writes smutty online listicles) with a roster of friends-with-benefits which include Mr. Good Time, Ms. Blue, Mr. Shit-hit-the-fan and Mr. Pre-incarceration. 

After a string of bad choices and a lost bet, she finds herself on a cheap flight to Iran. Problem is, this basic bitch doesnâ€™t even know where Iran is on a map, let alone packed herself a headscarf. Overwhelmed and far from home, there are only two things to comfort her: Iranians are incredibly good looking, and she seems to be their forbidden fruit. 

This romance novel is based on real events over the summer of 2018, with names and other small details changed to protect the guilty.
