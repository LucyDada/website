Everything in the following pages is true and based on real-life events over the summer of 2018. Names have been changed for the sake of privacy - including my own. Some of the people in my life were asked for permission to be included in these pages, others were not. Like Mr. Dingleberries. Or my Boss. Or Donald Trump. Or British Petroleum.

Thank you.

Two months is Ms. Blue's maximum no-see time. She'd made this quite clear and I didn't want to test her. It was about seven weeks since we last saw each other ("Is this what you want to do with your life?,” she'd asked after I showed her my Dingleberries listicle). It's also been a couple of weeks of me ignoring her texts for about 24 hours before messaging back...

“So what's going on?” Ms. Blue said in the doorway of her flat. She wouldn't even let me in. I had to explain myself and I had to do it well.

“It's been crazy,” I replied.

“It always is,” she said and didn't budge from the entrance.

“But not busy crazy,” I tried another angle, “Nothing crazy. No change, no news, nothing.”

Her facial features changed slightly - less 'Die bitch die' and more 'I pity you' -  and I continued down this promising path:

“It's a feeling French people probably have a word for, I don't know… Nothing's sticking. There's no rewards at work, or anywhere, and I'm going mad from waiting for anything at all to happen. That kind of crazy.”

She uncrossed her arms, walked up to me and gave me a hug. Her hair smelt of fruits from faraway places and her breasts pressed up hard against my own. I thought she wasn't wearing a bra: this was now confirmed.

But it wasn't a hug at all, it was a wrestler's body lock. I relaxed into it anyway.

“Lucy?” she said in my ear not relaxing her grip.

“Yeah?” I tried to kiss her neck but it was protected by a barrier of thick curly hair.

“You're so full of shit.”

I heard her smile even though I couldn't see it.

“If you had been in trouble I would've come right away...”

“Save your superman complex.” She let go of me to look at my face: “Don't ghost me.”

“I'm sorry,” I said. And I meant it too.

She kissed my cheek. That's what she'd been looking for - an apology - I can't believe I hadn't started with that, but then again I'm a fucking idiot. She went inside and I followed her in.

I heard the television suddenly turn on as I walked past the living room. Her flatmates' eyes were glued to the screen. Our little drama had an audience. Of course it did.

“Hi guys,” I said.

“Hiya Lucy,” said the sing-song voices. There are two of them - two blond women that wear leather jackets and ankle-length trousers to their charity desk jobs every day. I've never really expended the mental effort to tell them apart and I wasn't going to start now. I went to Ms. Blue's room and shut the door. She was busying herself rearranging this and that.

Is having the freedom to do (or not do) as I please worth this icy atmosphere and public grovelling? Yes. Yes it is. So with that in mind I sat my arse on her bed and waited for her to thaw out.

“How's your sister doing?” I asked.

“Good... She finally got her car fixed.”

“About time!”

“Yeah...”

“And did you make that deadline?” I asked.

“Which one?” she asked, testing me. This went on and on: her scumbag boss, her flatmate's burnout, her art, her website for her art, her feelings about Donald Trump, the control-freak admin in a facebook group she's in that coordinates volunteers to help refugees in Greece, the squirrel that's coming to her window to eat.

I listened to all of it. Really listened. Bit by bit her eyes softened, the tidying up lessened, her shoulders relaxed.

“Have you heard of passive restraint?” she asked me.

“No...” I replied. Sounded kinda kinky. It snapped my mind out of thinking about nicotine.

“It's about the power of small things.”

“Uh huh.”

“The fact is most days are like every other day. It's your desire for things to be different that's causing all this frustration in your life,” she said.

“I told you, I'm fine! Didn't Confucius say, 'hope you're not living in boring times?' Well, you're right, it can't be helped. I accept my life is boring.”

“He never said that! Stop making up Confucius quotes.”

I shrugged. She continued: “If you want to know what I think's up it's that: you think yourself a big person and you can't live up to your own expectations.”

“If anyone here can't accept that I'm a nobody it's you.” I had waited over a month to fire that shot.

“You misunderstood, as usual. I meant that we all are nobodies. We're all small. I'm trying to tell you why you feel so bad - you think your life should be grander than it is but it can't be!”

“Again, I agree. So writing about dingleberries suits me just fine as the lowly worm I am.”

I looked at the door to check if it still existed. It did. I continued sitting on the bed.

“See?! Right there! Just then: you go back and forth between thinking of yourself as some genius or as a piece of shit-”

“Lowly worm,” I interrupted.

“Whatever. Just accept being small for your own sake! A small person taking pleasure in small things.”

Her eyes were worried now and I couldn't look at them any longer. Her worry was infectious. I lied down on the bed, grabbed one of her pillows and covered my head with it - took a moment to myself to make a plan which she respected in silence. Every conversation with her was a lecture, it was so draining. I could walk around the corner and get an Uber? Sit through this telling off and stay the night? My mind went blank and my emotions were on the fence.

So I rephrased the matter to myself: boobs or no boobs? Life's all about asking the right questions. I sat back up on the bed ready to momentarily confess to whatever sin she wanted, although I presumed she wanted the sin in more *psychological language*.

“I'm such a *narcissist*, I'm sorry.”

Bingo. She got all flustered and sat next to me touching my thigh, my shoulder, my hands, “No, that's not it at all! You misunderstood.”

She was wrong. I understood completely. We had to go through a to-do list of tellings-off and grievances to get to this point. And here we were at the end of the list. But we'd be here all night waiting for her to make the first move. Out there she punched nazis, she organised rallies, she put her body on the line. But in here, she wanted to be told what to do, she wanted to play by someone's rules willingly and obediently. It gave her pleasure to give me her body to do as I pleased.

I kissed her. She began to talk so I kissed her again.

“I hope you understand-” she started but I interrupted her with my tongue in her mouth.

Not soon after her glorious breasts were in my hands, her hard nipples in my mouth and her soft, squirming body underneath me. If I played her just right, if I took her to the edge but brought her back, these little noises escaped her mouth: the greatest dopamine hit of all.

Tonight those rare little noises weren't so rare though. Definitely a case of lady blue balls, she probably hadn't masturbated in awhile.

She was hungrier than usual. She pushed up my skirt, pulled down my panties and started pushing buttons. She looked at me as she flicked my bean.

“See? Pleasure in the small things,” she said staring me down.

“No. The big things,” I replied grabbing both her breasts and tugging them.

She gave me a wicked grin as she shifted my thighs further apart before eating me out.

I made a mental note never to let more than a couple of weeks pass without seeing her again. Of course, that didn't happen.
