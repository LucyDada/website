I don't subscribe to the 'full orange' female empowerment mantra. That doesn't mean I advocate codependency. Far from it.

But a strong, single lady can die of thirst, of hunger, of illness, from injuries, if she's too hot or too cold. People need people. And I need more people than most people. Maybe that's just being a hoe bag, but a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.

I go by the 'emotional wheel' approach to dating. Just like a vocal range, everybody has a feelings range: some people can hit the mood, others are feeling-deaf. Rather than be limited to one person's emotional capabilities I have a pick'n'mix of people. First is my mono-polar lovers:

* Mr. Good Time - just your average hedonist. With an above average dealer.

* And Mr. Shit-hit-the-fan - just your average nihilist. No shred of hope for better days for the human race in general, and for himself in particular.

And then there's the lovers I go to depending on my energy levels:

When I'm feeling low in energy I tend to seek out Ms. Blue, to wade with her in the muddy rivers of life and remind ourselves that life's over after one go-round. However, I only see her when her life is full of other projects - ra-ra activist projects - because otherwise, if she's feeling high energy, I myself become her project (learned that the hard way).

Then there's my high arousal guy, Mr. Pre-incarceration. I only see him after 23:00. I call him that because I'm pretty sure he'll soon be behind bars - it makes sense, everyone behind bars is high energy and is obsessed with the next big thing they're working towards. Each night with Mr. Pre-incarceration pushes my boundaries, and maybe I just hope he goes to jail before I end up in A&E with some random object stuck up my arse and/or knife fight wounds.

And then there are a lot of guest appearances (or one-time appearances):

* Miss My-parents-are-loaded-&-all-I-do-is-watch-the-Simpsons,

* Mr. Professional poker player,

* Mr. DMT-too-much,

* Dr. Know nothing,

* Mr. I-talk-about-guitar-more-than-play-it,

* Ms. White-Saviour complex,

* Mr. Paranoid investigative reporter,

* Mrs. Philanderer (and it doesn't count as cheating because you have a vagina - don't message me between these hours).

* And, of course, Mr. Dingleberries.
