Dingleberries generally, but dingleberries on Tinder dates in particular. My next assignment to write up by tomorrow afternoon.

Ms. Blue's opinion on the matter you already know. But here's my two cents: I've worked at this office - a digital media and broadcasting company you've probably heard of - for four years now. First as an intern and then as a full-time writer. Still paid shit. Still no better alternative. Still not talented enough. Still not hot enough. As I see it, writing about dingleberries is as easy a ride as I can get.

This is the gist of it before it gets the listicle treatment:

I had a guy over at mine - we're 69ing, he's whistleblowing my clit, I'm trying to wrangle his dick in my mouth - and there they were.

They say don't ask questions you don't want to know the answers to, and this one should be at the top of the list:

“Did you not wipe your asshole clean before shoving it'n my face?” I asked him.

“Uh what?” he said after getting his head out of my crotch. He had a look on his face like he's trying to remember what 8 times 8 equals.

I pushed his heavy body off me and dry heaved slightly. He fled and I imagined the dingleberries dropping on the floor as he ran to the bathroom. I dry heaved again - that one nearly not dry.

He was gone for a long time: long enough to pull out my phone and bring my knowledge of carpet cleaners to a high level. When he returned - apologising - he got back in bed with little eye contact. He smelt of baby wipes and hand soap.

So there we were: premature pillow talk.

I was ready to suggest listening to a podcast and smoking a joint, but I wasn't rushing it. I wanted him to be Mr. Dingleberries for a little longer. Let him stew in it. Hold it over his head for a bit (so to speak).

“So, what do you do?” he broke the silence.

“I'm a writer.”

“Cool. What about?”

“Mostly sex and dating.”

The sunken look on his face was kind of endearing. That was the face of someone who realised then and there that I might write about this very moment, and oh if that were true, so long as people breathe and eyes can see he'll be known as Mr. Dingleberries.

He wasn't wrong - he exists as Mr. Dingleberries in your head now too.

“You want to listen to a podcast?” I asked letting him off the hook.

He nodded, and I told him to choose one as I rolled a joint in silence. I passed it to him eventually. He took several shallow drags and quickly passed it back.

What was the podcast about? Can't remember.

Did we have sex afterwards? Yes.

Why? Not only was he squeaky clean for round two, it made it even: I had now fucked Mr. Dingleberries and I could immortalise him as such.
